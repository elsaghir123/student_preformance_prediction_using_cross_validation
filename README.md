**Student-Performance-Prediction**

**Context**
Student performance is influenced by a combination of study habits, digital behavior, mental health, and lifestyle factors. Understanding these relationships helps in predicting academic success, detecting burnout risks, and improving student productivity. Machine learning models can assist in analyzing these factors to support early intervention and better academic outcomes.

📊 **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance Dataset, available on Kaggle:
